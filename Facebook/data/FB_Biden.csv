2020-12-12 19:15:54,"Five years ago today, the world gathered to adopt the Paris Agreement on climate change. The product of years of tough diplomacy, the Paris Agreement created an unprecedented framework for global action to avoid potentially catastrophic planetary warming, while building global resilience to the climate impacts we are already experiencing. It sent a clear signal that nearly 200 countries were — finally, together —moving toward a clean-energy future.

U.S. leadership was essential to negotiating Paris and indispensable to bringing the Agreement into force. Over the last four years, however, the world has lost that momentum, and nations and people in every part of the world are feeling the devastating impacts of a changing climate. We haven’t come close to the bold action that’s needed, and today, we have no time to waste.

The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one of my presidency, and I’ll immediately start working with my counterparts around the world to do all that we possibly can, including by convening the leaders of major economies for a climate summit within my first 100 days in office. The Biden-Harris Administration will increase the ambition of our domestic climate target and put the country on a sustainable path to achieve net-zero emissions no later than 2050. We’ll elevate the incredible work cities, states, and businesses have been doing to help reduce emissions and build a cleaner future. We’ll listen to and engage closely with the activists, including young people, who have continued to sound the alarm and demand change from those in power. And we’ll do all of this knowing that we have before us an enormous economic opportunity to create jobs and prosperity at home and export clean American-made products around the world, harnessing our climate ambition in a way that is good for American workers and the U.S. economy.

As we mark this anniversary, I am grateful to leaders around the world and across the country — at all levels — who remained steadfast in their commitment to the goals we embraced five years ago in Paris. And, under a Biden-Harris Administration, America will be back working with our partners around the world to ensure we realize those goals for the sake of our families and future generations.",68505

2020-12-10 15:25:10,"Seventy two years ago, Eleanor Roosevelt and other leaders from around the globe adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, affirming that all human beings are “born free and equal in dignity and rights.” From the horrors of a world war, they championed a simple yet revolutionary truth — that peace, prosperity, and justice rely on our obligation to uphold the universal rights of all.

Today, we recognize Human Rights Day and honor those who work tirelessly, often at great personal risk, to defend fundamental freedoms and fight oppression. Around the world, authoritarian leaders desperate to maintain their grip on power deny this truth: internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms are each — equally — the entitlement of all. It makes no difference where we live and no matter how we look, how we pray, or whom we love. In too many countries, people are imprisoned and face torture or death for speaking their minds, reporting the news, or demanding their rights.

This year, amid a pandemic and global protests, we are reminded of how much work remains to be done to root out the systemic inequities that continue to cut short lives and imperil livelihoods. And as we work with partners and through international organizations to advance human rights globally, we must also recognize that our task begins at home. Every American — regardless of race, ethnicity, zip code, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability — should be free to flourish in a society that values and defends equal justice for all. We must lead by the power of our example, standing in solidarity with generations of brave women and men who have fought for our common dignity.

That means providing access to high-quality, affordable health care, protecting and strengthening economic security for Americans with disabilities, and ensuring that students with disabilities have the resources necessary to mitigate the significant effects this pandemic has had on their education. We must ensure that people of color with disabilities have a fair shot and are treated equally. And, as the global pandemic underscores how connected we are to communities across the globe, we must also recognize the ways we can champion and promote inclusion and accessibility for people with disabilities everywhere.

2020-11-25 18:57:00,"Violence against women and girls is a global epidemic, affecting millions. As many as 1 in 3 women is the victim of gender-based violence at some point in her life, and that rate is even higher for women of color, lesbian and bisexual women, transgender individuals, and other members of vulnerable or underserved communities. This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has made matters worse, creating a “shadow pandemic” for many women and girls who are largely confined to their home with their abuser and facing economic insecurity that makes escape more difficult.

Today, on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, I reaffirm my commitment to restore U.S. leadership in confronting this global scourge — and that starts right here at home. Writing and passing the Violence Against Women Act as a United States Senator remains one of my proudest legislative achievements. As vice president, I worked to end the culture of sexual assault and silence in this country by strengthening Title IX protections for students and creating the ""It's On Us"" program to help empower people to intervene to prevent sexual assault. As president, the vice president and I will work with the Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. We will also address the growing rates of domestic violence and sexual assault during the COVID-19 crisis and restore Title IX protections for student survivors of sexual assault, stalking, and dating violence.

Our administration will renew the power of our example overseas and rejoin global efforts to confront gender-based violence in all its forms. We will ensure that women and girls fleeing gender-based violence in other parts of the world can seek asylum here and that visas are available to protect survivors who are not U.S. citizens.

They stand as part of a proud chain of warrior patriots reaching back to the earliest days of our republic, each one taking up the sacred mission to defend our nation’s highest values, our liberty, and democracy. The women and men who have fought and sacrificed for our country are heroes, and the rest of us owe them an unpayable debt. They have earned our thanks and, above all, our respect.

For many years, I have said that we as a nation have many obligations, but we have only one truly sacred obligation: to prepare and equip our troops we send into harm’s way, and to care for them and their families when they return home. For our veterans, that means providing a future of security, opportunity, and dignity; world class health care provided by the VA, with women and LGBTQ+ veterans receiving culturally competent care; and addressing the mental health crises and epidemic of suicide that are claiming too many of our veterans and service members. We have to make clear to everyone suffering from unseen wounds that there is honor and strength in reaching out for help. And we have to make sure that no veteran is locked out of treatment for conditions related to toxic exposures or traumatic brain injuries experienced in the line of duty. Fulfilling our promises to our veterans and military families, caregivers, and survivors is critical to our national security, because it is how we will ensure that future generations continue to volunteer to serve.

For the Biden family, this is also a personal commitment. We learned what it really means to be part of a military family the year that Beau deployed to Iraq with his National Guard unit. We prayed every night and morning for his safety, and we missed him at every family gathering or when tucking his children in at night. It was hard. It hurt. These are challenges most American families never have to face. And yet, Jill and I were constantly in awe when visiting with wounded service members at Christmas or hosting veterans in our home for dinners, at the pride our military members and veterans feel in their service, and at their matchless sense of duty. They are the absolute best of our country.

This Veterans Day, I feel the full weight of the honor and the responsibility that has been entrusted to me by the American people as the next president, and I vow to honor our country’s sacred obligation. To all of our proud veterans, know that I will be a commander in chief who respects your sacrifice, understands your service, and who will never betray the values you fought so bravely to defend. I will never treat you or your families with anything less than the honor you deserve.",317206

2020-10-31 01:16:26,"More than 9 million cases of COVID-19 have been now confirmed in the United States — 20 percent of the world's reported caseload — and the virus is surging in nearly every state. More than 228,000 Americans have lost their lives. It is as severe an indictment of a president's record as one can possibly imagine, and it is utterly disqualifying. Anyone who is responsible for plunging and ensnaring America in this crisis — anyone who could do so without an ounce of shame or a shred of empathy — should not be president.

As deeply worrying as the trendlines are right now across the country, the terrifying truth is that the situation could get still markedly worse for Americans, as Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans move within striking distance of destroying the Affordable Care Act once and for all.

But they underestimate the American people. For more than eight months, in the absence of any leadership from Trump, the American people have stepped up to care and look out for one another, as nurses and fire-fighters, doctors and police officers, farmworkers and grocers, researchers and community volunteers. All doing for our country what our president could not, did not, and would not.

2020-10-29 20:00:55,"Latinas are the hearts of their families and communities. So often, they’re the main breadwinners and the caregivers, too. Our economy does not work without them – but for too long, they have been underpaid and undervalued. On Latina Equal Pay Day, we call attention to the fact that Latinas make only 54 cents on the dollar compared to the average, non-Hispanic white man. That means they’ll lose over $1 million over their lifetime in comparison. It’s wrong.

And now, President Trump’s failed response to this pandemic has plunged our nation not just into a recession, but into a “she-cession” – with millions of women, particularly Latinas and women of color, bearing the brunt of lost hours, lost wages, lost businesses, and lost jobs. Millions of Latinas are still out of work or have dropped out of the labor force completely since COVID-19 hit.

Our country can’t afford another four years of Donald Trump. Latinas know they deserve better – and that is why they are mobilizing, voting, and making sure their friends and family turn out at the polls. Latinas are demanding an equal shot at opportunity and prosperity, and a fairer, more inclusive future for their families.

As President, I’ll work for them every day. That starts with containing this virus—which has so disproportionately hit the Latino community—so we can get our lives back. And I’ll make sure we don’t just rebuild; we’ll build back better, closing the gender wage gap and fighting wage discrimination, so that Latinas — and all women — are paid equally for equal work. I’ll also fight to pass a $15 federal minimum wage; make it easier for workers to organize and bargain collectively; and break down barriers to higher paying jobs, including by boosting training and education opportunities and providing paid family leave, affordable child care, and affordable health care.

The economic challenges facing Latinas have been ignored and worsened by President Trump. A Biden-Harris Administration will build back better for them and their families, starting from day one.",28401

2020-10-28 00:32:41,"Our hearts are broken for the family of Walter Wallace Jr., and for all those suffering the emotional weight of learning about another Black life in America lost. We cannot accept that in this country a mental health crisis ends in death. It makes the shock and grief and violence of yesterday’s shooting that much more painful, especially for a community that has already endured so much trauma. Walter Wallace’s life, like too many others’, was a Black life that mattered — to his mother, to his family, to his community, to all of us.

At the same time, no amount of anger at the very real injustices in our society excuses violence. Attacking police officers and vandalizing small businesses, which are already struggling during a pandemic, does not bend the moral arc of the universe closer to justice. It hurts our fellow citizens. Looting is not a protest, it is a crime. It draws attention away from the real tragedy of a life cut short. As a nation, we are strong enough to both meet the challenges of real police reform, including implementing a national use of force standard, and to maintain peace and security in our communities. That must be our American mission. That is how we will deliver real justice. All Donald Trump does is fan the flames of division in our society. He is incapable of doing the real work to bring people together. We will.

Joe Biden Speech in Durham, North Carolina LIVE",8037
2020-10-18 18:45:46,"President Trump is in deep denial, and Americans keep dying because of it. We heard the President congratulate himself on a job well done and claim yet again that our nation is ‘rounding the corner’ on this deadly pandemic — even as cases rise across the country. But, like most of what this president says, his empty boasts were completely unsupported by the facts or the reality faced by the millions of Americans who have been sickened, lost loved ones, lost jobs, or lost hope.

The Trump Administration isn’t protecting our economy or our entrepreneurs either. We learned earlier this week that, behind closed doors, President Trump’s economic advisors raised early alarms about COVID to their Wall Street pals while the Administration was downplaying the threat in public. Small businesses across the country have been forced to shutter because President Trump’s relief programs predictably favor the rich and well-connected. Today’s report from the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis confirmed in stark detail what so many business owners already knew: the cost of this administration’s failure to look out for Main Street even as it gets battered, particularly the minority- and women-owned businesses who were forced to the back of the line by his policies.

Enough is enough. President Trump has failed in the most basic duty of his office: to protect American’s lives and livelihoods. Instead, he has yet to lay out a clear plan to get this virus under control or get our economy safely back up and running for anyone without an address on Park Avenue or Wall Street. I’ll fight for working families by implementing the plan we’ve needed for the last eight months to get the virus under control, provide economic relief for families struggling to make ends meet, and support our small businesses. And I’ll protect and expand our health care and make the investments we need to build our nation back better.",54735

Complications from COVID-19, like lung scarring and heart damage, could well become the next pre-existing condition. Children under 26 could no longer be covered on their parents' health care.

Native Americans have always honored their deep connection to the land and kept faith with the rich spiritual traditions and heritage of their ancestors, often in the face of policies and violence that sought to strip them of both. With boundless resilience and strength, despite centuries of mistreatment and broken promises, Tribal Nations have fought to preserve their sovereign rights while also making countless contributions to strengthen the character of the United States — the famed American Indian Code Talkers who were critical to defeating fascism in World War II, the activism and leadership of Native women, and so much more. It is a part of our history that every American must learn and respect.

Our nation has never lived up to our full promise of equality for all — especially not when it comes to the rights of the indigenous people who were here long before ships arrived from Europe. Today, we are seeing again the full consequences of the inequity that has long held back Tribal Nations as this pandemic tears through Native communities at an alarming and disproportionate rate. We must not allow this unfulfilled promise to continue to perpetuate unequal outcomes for yet another generation of our Native youth.

As President, I’ll make tribal sovereignty and upholding our federal trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribal Nations the cornerstones of federal Indian policy. I’ll support self-determination and promote self-governance. I’m proud of the detailed plan I’ve outlined to strengthen the nation-to-nation relationship that builds on the progress we made together under the Obama-Biden Administration. It includes putting more land into trust and protecting our natural and cultural treasures; boosting investment in schools, roads, housing, clean water, and broadband creating good-paying jobs; tackles the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women; and it increases funding for the Indian Health Service and finally makes that funding mandatory.

On this Indigenous People’s Day, we must both recognize the past that has brought us here and commit to one another to write a new future of promise, partnership, and equal opportunity for the proud Tribal Nations of our country.",68233

As a nation, we are at a crossroads. We have come to a point where, despite our shock, we are not surprised that such a heinous plot was even conceived — a plot by Americans to blow up a bridge on American soil, threaten the lives of police officers and other law enforcement officials, and kidnap an American leader, take her hostage, and stage a mock trial for treason. It’s the kind of twisted plot we expect from ISIS, but now it’s here at home.

The words of a president matter. They can move markets. They can bring peace. They can bring war. They can heal divisions or incite violence.

When Governor Whitmer worked to protect the people of her state from a deadly pandemic, and saved countless lives, President Trump issued a call to “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” That call was heard. When protesters with Swastikas and Confederate flags, nooses, and assault rifles descended on Michigan’s capitol echoing the President’s own refrain to “lock her up,” President Trump called them “very good people.” He was heard, just as he was heard by neo-Nazis in Charlottesville three years ago, and again last week, when he told the extremist Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by.""

There is a throughline from President Trump’s dog whistles and tolerance of hate, vengeance, and lawlessness to plots such as this one. He is giving oxygen to the bigotry and hate we see on the march in our country.

We have to stop it.

I just spoke a few days ago in Gettysburg about the cost of division in this country and the need to stand up and shut down violence and hate. The moment has come. We need to come together for the country I know, for the country you know. We need to make our voice heard.

2020-10-02 01:34:02,"On October 1, 2017, Las Vegas was struck by tragedy when a gunman opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest Festival, killing 60 people and wounding hundreds more in what remains the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. It was an act of pure malice, and yet another appalling act of gun violence - the kind that takes the lives of 100 Americans every day.

Rather than let tragedy define the city, Nevadans did what you always do in hard times — you were resilient.

In the aftermath of the shooting, we heard stories of residents putting their own lives at risk to provide aid to the wounded and community members lining the streets to donate blood. First responders and emergency room workers saved lives. The community came together around being #VegasStrong — raising funds for families of victims and survivors’ medical costs, and within days of the shooting working to construct a memorial to honor victims.

The story of Nevada’s resilience reflects the spirit of America that I know. On this solemn day, Jill, Kamala, Doug and I pray for the victims of the Route 91 shooting and their families, as well as the survivors and first responders carrying this experience with them today.",11199

2020-09-26 23:29:16,"Election Day is just weeks away, and millions of Americans are already voting because the stakes in this election could not be higher. They feel the urgency of this choice – an urgency made all the more acute by what’s at stake at the U.S. Supreme Court.

They are voting because their health care hangs in the balance. They are voting because they worry about losing their right to vote or being expelled from the only country they have ever known. They are voting right now because they fear losing their collective bargaining rights. They are voting to demand that equal justice be guaranteed for all. They are voting because they don’t want Roe v. Wade, which has been the law of the land for nearly half a century, to be overturned.

President Trump has been trying to throw out the Affordable Care Act for four years. Republicans have been trying to end it for a decade. Twice, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law as constitutional.

But even now, in the midst of a global health pandemic, the Trump Administration is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the entire law, including its protections for people with pre-existing conditions. If President Trump has his way, complications from COVID-19, like lung scarring and heart damage, could become the next deniable pre-existing condition.

Today, President Trump has nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett as the successor to Justice Ginsburg’s seat. She has a written track record of disagreeing with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision upholding the Affordable Care Act. She critiqued Chief Justice John Roberts’ majority opinion upholding the law in 2012.

The American people know the U.S. Supreme Court decisions affect their everyday lives. The United States Constitution was designed to give the voters one chance to have their voice heard on who serves on the Court. That moment is now and their voice should be heard. The Senate should not act on this vacancy until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress.",16304

2020-08-13 01:36:11,"Three years ago today, the world watched in horror as neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and far-right extremists with torches in hand descended on Charlottesville, Virginia, spewing the same anti-Semitic bile that was heard in Hitler’s Germany in the 1930s. It was a moment of testing for our country, and a wake-up call to the fact that hate never dies — it only hides. And when our leaders give it oxygen, it can come roaring back to life.

What happened next is seared in all our memories — a violent clash between the white nationalists and those who came together to stand against hate. Tragically, a brave young woman lost her life.

And then our president claimed that there were “very fine people on both sides.” Donald Trump had the audacity to assign moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those who stood against it.

I knew then that we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. And I knew then that I could not stand by and let Donald Trump destroy the core values of this nation. Now, three years later, we can see even more clearly that everything that has made America, America, is at stake.

Despite our imperfections as a nation, the American people have never given up or walked away from the founding ideals of our nation: that everyone is entitled to be treated equally and with dignity and respect. That is who we are. And together, we are far more powerful than the hatred we saw on that dark day three years ago, and in so many acts of hatred and violence since.

As we look ahead to the choice we must make as a country this November, let Charlottesville be a reminder of the national imperative we all share: to weed out the division that the president has created over the last four years and to come together — as one America. If we give Donald Trump four more years in office, he may irreparably damage the character of this nation and our very democracy. We cannot allow that to happen, and with Senator Kamala Harris standing as my running mate, I know that we will succeed in defeating Donald Trump and Mike Pence.

The American people will choose unity over division, hope over fear, and truth over lies. Let’s remind ourselves and the rest of the world exactly who we are and who we aspire to be.",26571

2020-08-11 22:38:13,"You make a lot of important decisions as president. But the first one is who you select to be your Vice President. I’ve decided that Kamala Harris is the best person to help me take this fight to Donald Trump and Mike Pence and then to lead this nation starting in January 2021.

These aren’t normal times. For the first time in our history, we’re facing three historic crises -- all at the same time. We’re facing the worst pandemic in 100 years. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The most powerful calls for racial justice in a generation. And we have a president who has both failed to lead on the virus -- costing lives and decimating our economy -- and fanned the flames of hate and division.

I need someone working alongside me who is smart, tough, and ready to lead. Kamala is that person.

I need someone who understands the pain that so many people in our nation are suffering. Whether they’ve lost their job, their business, a loved one to this virus. This president says he “doesn’t want to be distracted by it”. He doesn’t understand that taking care of the people of this nation -- all the people -- isn’t a distraction -- it’s the job. Kamala understands that.

I need someone who understands that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. And that if we’re going to get through these crises -- we need to come together and unite for a better America. Kamala gets that.

If I’m President, I’m committed to making things better -- not just in the short term, but sustainably, structurally, and permanently. We won’t have time to delay. I need a partner who can help deliver on those promises, and quickly.

I was privileged to serve this nation for two terms as Vice President alongside President Obama, a man of extraordinary character who I believe will go down in history as one of our great presidents. So, I know a thing or two about being Vice President. More than anything, I know it can’t be a political decision. It has to be a governing decision. If the people of this nation entrust me and Kamala with the office of President and Vice President for the next four years, we’re going to inherit a nation in crisis, a nation divided, and a world in disarray. We won’t have a minute to waste.

That’s what led me to Kamala Harris.

As a United States Senator from California, Kamala represents the biggest state in the union. She’s been one of the toughest and most effective Senators on two of the most important committees in the Senate -- Intelligence and Judiciary. Two committees that have directly dealt with some of the most important issues facing this nation at home and around the world.

She sits on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, where she deals with the nation’s most sensitive threats.

We’ve all watched her hold the Trump administration accountable for its corruption, stand up to a Justice Department that’s run amok, and be a powerful voice against their extreme nominations.

She’s been a leader on criminal justice and marriage equality. And she has focused like a laser on the racial disparities as a result of the coronavirus.

As California’s Attorney General, she led one of the biggest legal departments in the nation -- where she was a powerful advocate for people in taking on the big banks and protecting women and kids from abuse. She’s delivered billions in settlement money to consumers, taking on companies for fraud, pollution and abuse.

I first met Kamala through my son Beau. They were both Attorneys General at the same time. He had enormous respect for her and her work. I thought a lot about that as I made this decision. There is no one’s opinion I valued more than Beau’s and I’m proud to have Kamala standing with me on this campaign.

Her record of accomplishment -- fighting tooth and nail for what’s right -- is why I’m choosing her. There is no door Kamala won’t knock on, no stone she’ll leave unturned, if it means making life better -- for the people.

So join me today in welcoming Kamala Harris to our team.

She will wake up every day -- like I will -- thinking about how to make life better for people. How to rebuild our country back better. How to make it more just. How to win the next fight in the battle for the soul of this nation.

Because that’s what the Presidency -- and the Vice Presidency -- is. It’s a duty to care: for you, for all of us. This will be the fight of our administration, and there’s no better partner that I could have asked for.",108405

How could someone in flesh and blood be so courageous, so full of hope and love in the face of so much hate, violence, and vengeance? Perhaps it was the Spirit that found John as a young boy in the Deep South dreaming of preaching the social gospel; the work ethic his sharecropper parents instilled in him and that stayed with him; the convictions of nonviolent civil disobedience he mastered from Dr. King and countless fearless leaders in the movement; or the abiding connection with the constituents of Georgia’s 5th District he loyally served for decades.

Or perhaps it was that he was truly a one-of-a-kind, a moral compass who always knew where to point us and which direction to march.

It is rare to meet and befriend our heroes. John was that hero for so many people of every race and station, including us. He absorbed the force of human nature’s cruelty during the course of his life, and the only thing that could finally stop him was cancer. But he was not bitter. We spoke to him a few days ago for the final time. His voice still commanded respect and his laugh was still full of joy. Instead of answering our concerns for him, he asked about us. He asked us to stay focused on the work left undone to heal this nation. He was himself – a man at peace, of dignity, grace and character.

John’s life reminds us that the most powerful symbol of what it means to be an American is what we do with the time we have to make real the promise of our nation – that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally. Through the beatings, the marches, the arrests, the debates on war, peace, and freedom, and the legislative fights for good jobs and health care and the fundamental right to vote, he taught us that while the journey toward equality is not easy, we must be unafraid and never cower and never, ever give up.

That is the charge a great American and humble man of God has left us. For parents trying to answer their children’s questions about what to make of the world we are in today, teach them about John Lewis. For the peaceful marchers for racial and economic justice around the world who are asking where we go from here, follow his lead. For his fellow legislators, govern by your conscience like he did, not for power or party. He was our bridge – to our history so we did not forget its pain and to our future so we never lose our hope.

To John’s son, John Miles, and to his family, friends, staff, and constituents, we send you our love and prayers. Thank you for sharing him with the nation and the world.

Every person of conscience can understand the rawness of the trauma people of color experience in this country, from the daily indignities to the extreme violence, like the horrific killing of George Floyd.

Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It’s an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not.

The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason we protest. It should not drive people away from the just cause that protest is meant to advance.

I know that there are people all across this country who are suffering tonight. Suffering the loss of a loved one to intolerable circumstances, like the Floyd family, or to the virus that is still gripping our nation. Suffering economic hardships, whether due to COVID-19 or entrenched inequalities in our system. And I know that a grief that dark and deep may at times feel too heavy to bear.

I know.

And I also know that the only way to bear it is to turn all that anguish to purpose. So tonight, I ask all of America to join me — not in denying our pain or covering it over — but using it to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity for our great democracy.

We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us.

As President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen. I will keep the commitment I made to George’s brother, Philonise, that George will not just be a hashtag. We must and will get to a place where everyone, regardless of race, believes that ""to protect and serve"" means to protect and serve them.

2020-05-01 15:31:33,"April was Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Every year, at this time, we talk about awareness, prevention, and the importance of women feeling they can step forward, say something, and be heard. That belief — that women should be heard — was the underpinning of a law I wrote over 25 years ago. To this day, I am most proud of the Violence Against Women Act. So, each April we are reminded not only of how far we have come in dealing with sexual assault in this country — but how far we still have to go.

When I wrote the bill, few wanted to talk about the issue. It was considered a private matter, a personal matter, a family matter. I didn’t see it that way. To me, freedom from fear, harm, and violence for women was a legal right, a civil right, and a human right. And I knew we had to change not only the law, but the culture.

So, we held hours of hearings and heard from the most incredibly brave women — and we opened the eyes of the Senate and the nation — and passed the law.

In the years that followed, I fought to continually strengthen the law. So, when we took office and President Obama asked me what I wanted, I told him I wanted oversight of the critical appointments in the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice and I wanted a senior White House Advisor appointing directly to me on the issue. Both of those things happened.

As Vice President, we started the “It’s on Us” campaign on college campuses to send the message loud and clear that dating violence is violence — and against the law.

We had to get men involved. They had to be part of the solution. That’s why I made a point of telling young men this was their problem too — they couldn’t turn a blind eye to what was happening around them — they had a responsibility to speak out. Silence is complicity.

In the 26 years since the law passed, the culture and perceptions have changed but we’re not done yet.

It’s on us, and it’s on me as someone who wants to lead this country. I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished. So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago.

They aren’t true. This never happened.

While the details of these allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault are complicated, two things are not complicated. One is that women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced. The second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny.

Responsible news organizations should examine and evaluate the full and growing record of inconsistencies in her story, which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways.

But this much bears emphasizing.

She has said she raised some of these issues with her supervisor and senior staffers from my office at the time. They — both men and a woman — have said, unequivocally, that she never came to them and complained or raised issues. News organizations that have talked with literally dozens of former staffers have not found one — not one — who corroborated her allegations in any way. Indeed, many of them spoke to the culture of an office that would not have tolerated harassment in any way — as indeed I would not have.

There is a clear, critical part of this story that can be verified. The former staffer has said she filed a complaint back in 1993. But she does not have a record of this alleged complaint. The papers from my Senate years that I donated to the University of Delaware do not contain personnel files. It is the practice of Senators to establish a library of personal papers that document their public record: speeches, policy proposals, positions taken, and the writing of bills.

There is only one place a complaint of this kind could be — the National Archives. The National Archives is where the records are kept at what was then called the Office of Fair Employment Practices. I am requesting that the Secretary of the Senate ask the Archives to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document. If there was ever any such complaint, the record will be there.
As a Presidential candidate, I’m accountable to the American people. We have lived long enough with a President who doesn’t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That’s not me. I believe being accountable means having the difficult conversations, even when they are uncomfortable. People need to hear the truth.

I have spent my career learning from women the ways in which we as individuals and as policy makers need to step up to make their hard jobs easier, with equal pay, equal opportunity, and workplaces and homes free from violence and harassment. I know how critical women’s health issues and basic women’s rights are. That has been a constant through my career, and as President, that work will continue. And I will continue to learn from women, to listen to women, to support women, and yes, to make sure women’s voices are heard.

We have a lot of work to do. From confronting online harassment, abuse, and stalking, to ending the rape kit backlog, to addressing the deadly combination of guns and domestic violence.

We need to protect and empower the most marginalized communities, including immigrant and indigenous women, trans women, and women of color.

We need to make putting an end to gender-based violence in both the United States and around the world a top priority.

I started my work over 25 years ago with the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. As president, I’m committed to finishing the job.",29888

Jill and I are so thankful to Barack and Michelle for their support — both politically and personally. Their friendship and the connection between our families has been a great gift.

Serving for eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president was among the greatest honors of my life.

When we took office in 2009, America and the world were in crisis — with our economy shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs a month. During that crisis, President Obama showed how a president should lead. By taking responsibility. By working with governors and mayors. By understanding the pain so many American families were feeling. By seeking to unify the nation in common purpose.

These are difficult times again for our country. We’re facing a crisis even greater than what we experienced in 2009 and 2010. Lives are being lost. Our nation is shut down. Our way of life and our livelihoods are being challenged. Today, not only do we have a public health crisis, but our economy is rapidly descending into an economic crisis as well.

Once again, we need to restore the qualities of presidential leadership President Obama provided — and that is what I intend to do. To lead this nation. To unify this nation. To understand the fear, anxiety, and grief that all Americans are enduring — especially those who have lost loved ones to this virus. To recognize the heroism of so many Americans — including doctors, nurses, and health care workers; first responders, firefighters, and police; grocery store workers and delivery truck drivers. To work with the governors and mayors of this nation — not against them. To bring our nation together, united in common purpose.

President Obama understands, as I do, that we will come through this crisis stronger. And then we’ll not only rebuild this nation — we will transform it.",23379
2020-04-14 16:16:42,"I am not running for office to be King of America. I respect the Constitution. I’ve read the Constitution. I’ve sworn an oath to it many times. I respect the great job so many of this country’s governors — Democratic and Republican — are doing under these horrific circumstances.

Leadership is about never proclaiming power. It’s about collaboration, it’s about coming together in a crisis and finding common ground. It’s about results.

That’s who I am and the role I aspire to fulfill in guiding this democratic nation to better times.

2020-04-08 18:23:02,"Today, Senator Sanders announced he was suspending his campaign. Bernie has put his heart and soul into not only running for President, but for the causes and issues he has been dedicated to his whole life. So, I know how hard a decision this was for him to make — and how hard it is for the millions of his supporters — especially younger voters — who have been inspired and energized and brought into politics by the progressive agenda he has championed. Bernie has done something rare in politics. He hasn’t just run a political campaign; he’s created a movement. And make no mistake about it, I believe it’s a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday. That’s a good thing for our nation and our future.

Senator Sanders and his supporters have changed the dialogue in America. Issues which had been given little attention — or little hope of ever passing — are now at the center of the political debate. Income inequality, universal health care, climate change, free college, relieving students from the crushing debt of student loans. These are just a few of the issues Bernie and his supporters have given life to. And while Bernie and I may not agree on how we might get there, we agree on the ultimate goal for these issues and many more.

But more than any one issue or set of issues, I want to commend Bernie for being a powerful voice for a fairer and more just America. It’s voices like Bernie’s that refuse to allow us to just accept what is — that refuse to accept we can’t change what’s wrong in our nation — that refuse to accept the health and well-being of our fellow citizens and our planet isn’t our responsibility too. Bernie gets a lot of credit for his passionate advocacy for the issues he cares about. But he doesn’t get enough credit for being a voice that forces us all to take a hard look in the mirror and ask if we’ve done enough.

While the Sanders campaign has been suspended — its impact on this election and on elections to come is far from over. We will address the existential crisis of climate change. We will confront income inequality in our nation. We will make sure healthcare is affordable and accessible to every American. We will make education at our public colleges and universities free. We will ease the burden of student debt. And, most important of all, we will defeat Donald Trump.

At this moment, we are in the middle of an unprecedented crisis in American history. There is enormous fear and pain and loss being felt all across the country. There are also untold stories of heroism — of nurses and health care workers and doctors and first responders and grocery store workers and truck drivers and so many others on the front lines of this crisis. Putting their own lives in danger for the rest of us. If we didn’t know it before, we know it now: This is the backbone of our nation.

Our first job is to get through the immediate crisis threatening the public health and getting help into the pockets of America’s workers. But we also need to take a hard look at what we need to fix and change in this country. Many of the biggest cracks in the social safety net have been laid bare — from health care to paid sick leave to a more extensive and comprehensive system of unemployment benefits. We will need to address these. Just as we need to address rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure. And we all know — the clock is ticking — we don’t have a moment to waste in combating the climate crisis.

As friends, Jill and I want to say to Bernie and Jane, we know how hard this is. You have put the interest of the nation — and the need to defeat Donald Trump — above all else. And for that Jill and I are grateful. But we also want you to know: I’ll be reaching out to you. You will be heard by me. As you say: Not me, Us.

And to your supporters I make the same commitment: I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country. I hope you will join us. You are more than welcome. You’re needed.

Together we will defeat Donald Trump. And when we do that, we’ll not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation — we’ll transform it.

2020-02-07 16:43:03,"I grew up with a stutter. At this week's CNN town hall, I was asked what advice I would give to those working to overcome their own — here’s what I said:",30933
2020-02-07 02:08:07,"Folks,

I get to travel a lot these days. Less on the train than I would like. But everywhere I go, I meet people who tell me that they’ve given 5 or 10 bucks to our campaign, or that they’ve volunteered for us. These people are the heart of our operation, and if you’re reading this, you’re the heart of it, too.

I want to thank you personally for everything you’ve done for me and my family over the past nine months. And I wanted to share with you some thoughts about where we are as a campaign, and where we’re going to go now.

Monday night didn’t go the way we wanted. I said this yesterday: it was a punch to the gut.

But it wasn’t a knockout.

Growing up, my Dad had no patience for self-pity. He’d never judge a man or woman by how far they fell down, but instead by how quickly they got up. He always had a simple mantra: “Get up.”

Well, we’ve got to get up.

There are a lot of folks who want to write off this campaign already. Hell, they’ve been trying to do it from the moment I announced. Well -- I’ve got news for all of them. We’re not going anywhere.

We’re going to fight for this nomination. We’re going to fight for it in New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. We’re going to fight for it on Super Tuesday and beyond.

I have said from the moment I announced that we’re in a battle for the soul of this nation. I believe that even more today.

When I say that, sometimes people misunderstand. I’m not being nostalgic. I’m not trying to take America back to some period that never existed. We all know the animating promise of this nation -- that all men and women are created equal -- has never been fulfilled.

The soul of this nation wasn’t forged by Wall Street. It was forged by hard working people, looking for a chance. It was forged by ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It was forged by people like you -- the people standing with me to power this campaign.

When there are people who have been diagnosed with cancer, staring at the ceiling, wondering how they’re going to pay for it, that promise hasn’t been fulfilled.

When a 50 year old who just lost their job feels like they have no options, that promise hasn’t been fulfilled.

When a recent college graduate looks at their first loan bill and wonders how they’re possibly going to make ends meet, that promise hasn’t been fulfilled.

And when a little kid wakes up in the morning, afraid to go to school because of their religion, or because of their immigration status, or because of the color of their skin, or because of a disability, that promise hasn’t been fulfilled.

A couple of days ago, I was walking down the rope line at one of my town halls, and there was a little boy there. He had a familiar anxiety on his face. It was the anxiety of a kid with a stutter, something I struggled to overcome when I was a kid too. I saw the fear in that kid’s eyes. I saw how people had put him down. Counted him out. Stigmatized him. Set an arbitrary cap on what he could contribute to this world.

I saw how he felt. I knew how he felt.

I’m going to be a President for everyone who’s been written off. For every underdog, every fighter, every striver. I’m going to be a President for everyone staring at that proverbial ceiling, hoping against hope that they’ll get their chance, too.

But first, we need to show the world what we’re made of. We’ve got to get up. We’ve got to fight. And with you beside me, I know we will.

Keep the faith, and I’ll see you out there,

-Joe",5353

This is not a moment for celebration or aggressive partisan point-scoring, but a sobering reminder that the defining characteristic of Donald Trump's presidency is the abuse of power.

In broad daylight, in front of the whole world, this president indicted himself. He used his power as the head of state to coerce a foreign government into interfering in our elections on his behalf. And once he was caught in the act, he stood on the South Lawn of the White House in front of TV cameras and asked another foreign government to do the same.

He did it all because he was afraid of how badly I will beat him next November.

I have said all along that Congress' job is to investigate the President's misdeeds and proceed accordingly. My job is to make the case why he shouldn't be re-elected for another term regardless of the outcome.

The Republican-controlled Senate seems poised to vote their politics over their conscience and acquit President Trump. Which means Donald Trump may feel empowered to once again abuse his power in pursuit of his re-election. He will continue to do anything he can to make sure he does not have to face me at the ballot box next November.

This is about more than Trump’s attempts to fabricate an international scandal around me and my family to hurt my candidacy. It’s about the way a commander in chief should act.

2019-09-21 15:34:22,"28 years ago, the people of Armenia took their future into their own hands and reestablished their independence from the Soviet Union. Today is a day to celebrate Armenia’s democratic progress and to honor Armenia’s history. That history is not complete unless we recognize, once and for all, the Metz Yeghern — the Armenian Genocide. From 1915 to 1923, almost 2 million Armenians were deported en masse, and 1.5 million men, women, and children were killed. We must never forget or remain silent about this horrific and systematic campaign of extermination.

It is particularly important to speak these words and commemorate this history at a moment when we are reminded daily of the power of words to wound and our shared responsibility to speak out against hate — because silence is complicity. If we do not fully acknowledge, commemorate, and teach our children about genocide, the words “never again” lose their meaning. The facts must be as clear and as powerful for future generations as for those whose memories are seared by tragedy. Failing to remember or acknowledge the fact of a genocide only paves the way for future mass atrocities.

I stand with the people of Armenia and the Armenian-American community, which has contributed so much to our nation, in remembering the victims of the Armenian Genocide. During my years in the Senate, I was proud to lead the charge on Genocide recognition efforts, and I am proud today to support the resolutions now before the House and Senate to officially recognize and establish an ongoing U.S. commemoration of the Armenian Genocide.

2019-07-03 01:20:29,"Today marks 55 years since the signing of the Civil Rights Act — the landmark piece of legislation that brought our nation closer to fulfilling the promise that was made two centuries earlier in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A promise of equality, equity, and fairness for all.

It took the courage and determination of generations of African Americans who refused to wither in the face of racism and intolerance. Their resolve fundamentally changed the character of our nation for the better.

The Civil Rights Act for the first time made real the possibility of equal access to employment. It outlawed discrimination in public facilities, and it gave the Attorney General of the United States of America the power to enforce the law to combat discrimination.

It also laid the groundwork for other milestones and freedoms to follow — from the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Because when justice rings out for one group, it rings for all groups in America. We’re all made better.

2019-07-01 21:17:33,"Yet again, Donald Trump has demonstrated that he is more concerned with a photo op for himself than getting results for the American people. He has repeatedly elevated Kim Jong Un — a murderous tyrant — on the international stage in exchange for almost nothing. In this case, all Trump achieved was a mere promise to restart working-level negotiations — negotiations that should have never ended.

Diplomacy is important, but diplomacy requires a strategy, a process, and competent leadership to deliver. After three made-for-TV summits, we still don't have a single concrete commitment from North Korea. Not one missile or nuclear weapon has been destroyed, not one inspector is on the ground. If anything, the situation has gotten worse. North Korea has continued to churn out fissile material and is no longer an isolated pariah on the world stage.

And even as Trump has rushed to legitimize a dictator in North Korea with dozens of nuclear weapons, he trashed the Iran nuclear deal — a deal that was working to keep Iran far away from a single nuclear bomb. Iran needs to get back into compliance with its nuclear commitments, but Trump appears to have no plan for ensuring that result either. His policy of maximum pressure has produced worse than minimum results. Iran has now restarted its nuclear program and has become more, rather than less, aggressive.

2019-06-28 02:41:39,"Tonight, I’ll take the stage for the first Democratic debate to discuss my vision for the country. As I’ve said from day one, I’m running for president for three reasons: to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans.

We know in our bones this election is different. We have a president who promotes hate and division. Encourages white supremacists. Embraces dictators. And damages our alliances internationally.

Our politics traffics in division. And our president is the divider in chief.

Every day we are being reminded what this election is about. Who we are. What we stand for. What we believe. I am running to offer our country a different path – not back to a past that never was, but to a future that fulfills our true potential as a country.

We have to rebuild the backbone of this nation – the middle class. And this time make sure everyone comes along, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disability.

The poor are getting poorer and the bottom is falling out of the middle class. Income inequality is on the rise — made worse by the Trump tax cut that was a giant give-away to the super-wealthy.

It’s time to reward work, not just wealth. On day one, I’ll move to: eliminate the Trump tax cut for the super wealthy, cut the unjustified loopholes in our tax code, and use that money to invest in America’s future.

We need to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act. I was proud every day to serve alongside President Obama as Vice President – but never more so than the day the Affordable Care Act passed. Now we have to finish the job.

Under my plan, everyone will have the option to buy into a public health plan like Medicare. And we’ll guarantee that the poor – who otherwise would be covered by the Medicaid expansion – are automatically covered, free of charge.

We have to transform education. We’ll provide universal Pre-K, triple Title I funding, raise teacher pay, double the number of mental health professionals in our schools, and eliminate disparities between rich and poor schools.

Climate change is an existential threat. We have to take urgent, drastic action now to address the climate emergency. On day one, I’ll take the bold action necessary to tackle this crisis head-on and rally the world to raise our ambitions.

We can do all this and more - all that stands in the way is a broken political system. We have to unite this country. And we can do it without compromising our principles. That’s the only way we’re going to be able to harness the incredible potential of the American people.

We have to choose hope over fear, truth over lies, and unity over division. I hope you’ll tune in tonight as we discuss these important issues and more. If you like what you hear, I ask you to join us by signing up at https://joe.link/2XERyvX. Let’s get to work.

Lastly, the large, diverse Democratic field is evidence of our party's strength. And above all, we all agree that we need to make Donald Trump a one-term president.

2019-04-05 00:32:37,"70 years ago, the founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization signed the Washington Treaty, joining together to “safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization of their peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law.” With vision and foresight, they established the single most important military alliance in the history of the world—a check on the abuse of power by any one nation, and the basis upon which we have kept the peace, advanced stability, and strengthened our democracies for decades.

Over the years, as NATO has grown into the community of nations we are today, we have stood united, time and again, as a bulwark against threats to our collective security. It has been the foundation on which the United States has advanced our global leadership and shaped the arc of our shared future.

Today, NATO is as important as it has ever been. We must defend it. Preserving and strengthening our Alliance is paramount to the continued security and prosperity of the American people. Without a stable Atlantic alliance, in my view, everything falls apart.

And as we look to a future defined by threats that do not recognize borders and demand greater cooperation among nations, NATO must continue to evolve and grow—to meet new challenges in cyber, in space, and from rapidly advancing technologies—so that it remains the foundation of global security in the 21st century.",6930
2019-03-08 23:26:43,"Each year on International Women’s Day, we reaffirm the straightforward truth that achieving the goal of full and equal rights for women is essential to the success of all our nations. We will never advance if half the population is denied basic dignity. The right to be educated, to own property, to marry whom you choose, to engage in business and commerce, to live free from the threat of violence and fear—these are fundamental and universal human rights.

Advancing opportunities for women to contribute is not only a moral imperative, it is in the strategic interests of every country in the world. Cultures and societies that don't treat women as equal cannot attain the growth they need to prosper—that’s a core economic principle of our world in the 21st century. There can be no conversation about basic human rights and dignity, the ability to be free from tyranny and terrorism, or lifting communities out of poverty without the full participation women.

I’m inspired every day by the women I meet—here in the United States, and in countries around the world—who are driving the progress we need, leading the way, and working tirelessly to tear down the barriers society has built to hold women back. And I’m incredibly proud of the work that my wife, Jill, continues to do to focus attention and resources on communities and activists who are fighting, sometimes against seemingly impossible odds, for women and girls around the world.

Whenever Jill travels anywhere in the world, she returns home with the stories of the women she’s met—oftentimes young girls who have endured unspeakable traumas, yet who remain hopeful that the future will be better for their daughters; women whose spirits remain undaunted, with iron resolve tempered in the fires of adversity.

2019-02-01 01:32:58,"Today, the Biden Foundation submitted a comment to the Department of Education about proposed changes to #TitleIX guidance. These new rules would make it harder for survivors of sexual assault to seek justice, and allow schools to ignore the safety and needs of their students.

Students and survivors are making their voices heard. Grassroots organizers have been working tirelessly to make sure these guidelines are never put into effect.

End Rape on Campus executive director Jess Davidson has been advocating for safer campuses since long before I met her in the White House, and I’m so proud of all that she continues to accomplish. Know Your IX: a project of Advocates for Youth manager (and fellow Blue Hen) Sage Carson done so much for the students of Delaware, and is now fighting for students across the country.

Both these organizations created the #HandsOffIX website, which has helped thousands make their voices heard throughout the notice and comment process. But these are just a few of the many activists fighting tooth and nail to protect Title IX.

Organizations like It's On Us, RALIANCE, the National Women's Law Center, and the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence have all been essential in raising public awareness around this issue, and they are putting in the hours to ensure the Department of Education can’t turn the clock back on educational equality.

This country is built on the courage of ordinary Americans who stand up for what’s right. I couldn’t be prouder to stand alongside these brave leaders in the fight to protect students, support survivors, and save Title IX.",3030

2018-12-14 23:14:08,"Six years ago today, 20 first graders and 6 educators were gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Today, those children would have been in seventh grade. Six years of school plays not performed in. Six years of goals not scored, baskets not made, and baseballs not hit. Six years of missing hugs and kisses goodnight with their parents and siblings.

Since that fateful day in December 2012, there have been more than 1,900 mass shootings in this country. And countless other acts of gun violence are occurring every day, even though they aren’t making national headlines.

1,900 mass shootings later, it may feel like there’s not much more to say. But I will say this: we cannot accept this level of gun violence as our new normal. We cannot stop fighting for sensible gun laws. We have had the will to do this before. One of the proudest moments of my career was passing a ban on these weapons of war — assault weapons and high-capacity magazines — in 1994. We cannot simply accept that real action like this is no longer possible. Instead, we have to find the political courage to do it again. Because our children deserve better.

As we remember Sandy Hook, may God bless those angels, the brave educators who gave their lives to protect them, and the families left behind.",4891
2018-12-01 21:28:25,"On behalf of the whole Biden family, Jill and I would like to offer our deepest condolences, thoughts, and prayers to George, Jeb, Neil, Marvin, Doro, their children, and the entire Bush family. They have lost a father and grandfather. And this nation has lost a great leader.

When we went to Houston in 2015 to honor the doctors that cared for our deceased son Beau, President Bush insisted on coming out to see us. He wanted to personally welcome us to Houston and offer his condolences for the loss of our son.

That was George H.W. Bush—decent, kind, and welcoming. With President Bush it was seldom about himself. Always about others. His life of service was legendary.

From the moment he signed up as an 18-year-old Naval aviator a few months after Pearl Harbor and for every step after that in his lengthy career as a diplomat, Congressman, Vice President, and President – George H.W. Bush chose a path of service.

He was a man who presided over the peaceful end to the Cold War and the reunification of Germany. This was statesmanship and leadership of historic dimensions. So much could have gone wrong but instead went right because of his leadership. This is how history will rightly remember him. Every American — and arguably everybody on Earth — owes him a debt of gratitude for being such an able steward.

Over the course of the many years we worked together—and against each other—on the biggest issues of the day, differences of policy were always based on substance. It was never personal. It was never petty. It was always with respect for our institutions and the people they govern.

As we mourn his passing today, we remember a life totally and completely dedicated to the country he loved.",9405
2018-11-16 22:16:45,"Today, the US Department of Education published a rule that, if enacted, would discourage the reporting and investigation of sexual assault in our nation’s colleges, universities and K-12 schools.

When a parent drops their son or daughter off at college at the beginning of the school year, they worry, ""How will they do in school? Will they make friends? Will they be happy?"" They should never have to worry if their child is safe. Ever. Yet the statistics are devastating: 1 in 5 young women will experience sexual assault during her time in college.

I was proud that under the Obama-Biden Administration, we took on these unacceptable statistics by making it clear that under the law, any university or college receiving federal funding must promptly and fairly investigate every complaint of sexual violence.

Title IX is a law that protects students from sex discrimination in education, and it is hard to imagine a greater form of sex discrimination than a school’s failure to respond to sexual violence on campus. Imagine a victim of sexual assault being forced every day to face their assailant in the classroom, in the dorm, or in the school library.

Our guidance required schools to respond to complaints of sexual violence with a process that was fair to both parties and to take appropriate measures to help survivors stay in school and complete their education. We brought this hidden violence into the public eye, and we saw schools change their practices as a result. These protections made students safer and gave parents peace of mind.

Today’s proposed rollback would return us to the days when schools swept rape and assault under the rug and survivors were shamed into silence. Schools will have decreased liability for their response to sexual violence. And most disturbing, students will be placed at greater risk. We cannot go back.

We must continue our progress in changing the culture around sexual assault in this country and in our schools. We have to stand up for victims who have so bravely come forward, to remind them that they are not in this fight alone. We must speak up and make clear that we will not allow this Administration to take us backwards. You can make a difference by letting the US Department of Education know your views.

But I also learned that the cancer research and care system is not set up in a way that delivers the best possible experience and outcomes to patients.

Like nearly every American who has lost a loved one to this terrible disease, the fight to end cancer as we know it is personal to my wife Jill and me. Every day, every minute matters to patients and their loved ones and so we must bring that same urgency to changing the system.

Today we are hosting the #BidenCancerSummit in Washington DC and in over 450 communities around the world to bring together patients, providers, caregivers, and survivors to commit to making real, practical changes in the lives of cancer patients and their families.

John McCain will cast a long shadow. His impact on America hasn’t ended. Not even close. It will go on for many years to come.

As a POW, John endured the worst of what human beings can do to one another. In politics, he fell short of his greatest ambition. At the end of his life he faced a cruel and relentless disease. And yet through it all he never lost sight of what he believed most: Country First. And the spirit that drove him was never extinguished: we are here to commit ourselves to something bigger than ourselves.

John was many things – a proud graduate of the Naval Academy, a Senate colleague, a political opponent. But, to me, more than anything, John was a friend.

America will miss John McCain. The world will miss John McCain. And I will miss him dearly.

And that’s whether or not Latino Americans are dealt into the economy in a way that gives them an equal chance to succeed. If you believe in the basic bargain upon which this country was founded, then all you really need is that opportunity—an even chance to claim your place in the middle class.

2018-07-16 23:29:15,"This week, the President had the opportunity to assure our closest allies that America stands with them as we have for over 70 years. He could have rightly taken pride in increased defense spending among NATO allies since the Wales Summit in 2014, and the Alliance's firm resolve to counter threats to our collective security. Instead he insulted our friends and made common cause with our adversaries.

Today our President had the chance to confront an adversary who has attacked — and continues to attack — our democracy and our allies. He could have stood up for American interests and values. He chose not to.

Instead, he embraced our number one adversary, blamed America rather than Russian aggression for the deterioration in our bilateral relations, trashed his own justice department, and put Putin’s word above that of our own intelligence community whose leaders he appointed.

Attacking the values that make our democracy strong — including strong institutions, the rule of law, a free press and fair elections — does not help us lead abroad. Flattering dictators will not advance American interests. It makes us less safe.

Today’s press conference was beneath the dignity of the Office of the President. The President's words do not reflect what Americans think and who we are. Congress and the American people must speak out to make it clear that we believe in democracy over dictatorship, that we support our allies and not those who seek to weaken us, and that we will defend our freedom when it is attacked.",28028

Blaming our problems on scapegoats is exactly what authoritarian leaders want. -- Joe Biden",7085
2018-06-20 18:19:08,"This is not who we are. America is better than this.

What we are seeing at our border right now -- children only a few months old being pulled from their mothers’ arms, toddlers distraught and wailing for their parents, children being separated from their parents with no idea if they will ever see them again -- is fundamentally at odds with everything this nation stands for and believes.

A policy that separates young children from their parents isn’t a “deterrent”. It’s unconscionable.

A policy that traumatizes children isn’t a bargaining chip. It’s abhorrent.

And a President and an administration that continues this policy isn’t protecting our border and our people. It threatens to make us a pariah in the world.

I know how difficult this problem is. As Vice President, I was charged with leading our response when we saw a surge of unaccompanied minors on our border. And I can tell you the answer is not to toss aside our values, our principles, and our humanity.

The real key to solving this problem lies not on our border. We have to deal with this problem in countries these people are fleeing. Addressing the root causes of migration, as our administration did by pushing Central American governments to undertake ambitious political reforms and going after criminal groups responsible for the smuggling of drugs and people, is the only way to reduce the flows of migrants fleeing to the United States in search of a better life. It is hard. It is not simple. There is no easy or quick fix. And unfortunately, the current administration has cut back on the very tools needed to get the job done.

This President could end the practice of separating families right now if he wanted to -- and he should. It’s our duty to demand that he do so. Stand up. Show up. Speak out. No one, not even a President, can change who we are as America and what we stand for -- if we the people stand united and unleash all that power that is in our hands. We must remind this Administration of the core values that beat in the heart of this country. We must send the clearest possible signal to the rest of the world that America still represents the best of humanity -- not the worst.",25234

2018-05-08 22:37:03,"Today’s announcement that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal is a profound mistake. It will isolate the United States from nearly every major world power. It will weaken our credibility and global leadership. It will allow Iran to garner international sympathy while doing nothing to reduce its harmful activities across the Middle East.

All it will likely accomplish is to put Iran back on the path to a nuclear weapon with no clear diplomatic way out. This wholly unnecessary crisis could ultimately put the safety of our country and our fellow citizens, including thousands of men and women in uniform serving across the Middle East, at risk by setting us back on a path to war with Iran.

We should continue to work with our allies and partners to counter Iran’s ability to subvert Israel and other partners in the region. However, the deal provided a long-term check on Iran’s pathways to a nuclear bomb, buying us critical time and space to address the regime’s other destabilizing activities.

The fact is that the agreement has been working to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. The International Atomic Energy Agency says so. Our allies in Europe say so. Even the Trump administration has consistently certified Iran’s compliance, a fact confirmed by now-Secretary of State Pompeo's testimony just last month.

Talk of a “better deal” is an illusion. It took years of sanctions pressure, painstaking diplomacy, and the full support of the international community to achieve that goal. We have none of that in place today.

President Trump’s decision will do the opposite of what he says he intends. It will free up Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon and ultimately force us into a binary choice between engaging in a new military conflict or living with a nuclear-armed adversary, both of which pose grave national security risks. And it puts us at odds with our closest European allies, who repeatedly urged the United States to honor the agreement.

As a result, President Trump has manufactured a crisis for his own political interests that puts us on a collision course not only with an adversary but also with our closest partners. It is just the latest example of how President Trump’s notion of “America First” will leave America more alone and less secure.",21958

She spoke her mind with wit, intelligence, and steely confidence. Simply put, there was no one else quite like her.

Her tireless work as a champion for global literacy will be just one legacy she leaves behind.

It doesn’t have to be this way.

When I wrote the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, it included a provision that empowered women to take abusers to civil court. When police and prosecutors fell down on the job, a woman and her lawyer could step in. It was working. But then the Supreme Court killed this progress in a 5-4 ruling that I believe was fundamentally flawed.

It is now on Congress to step up and pass a new federal civil cause of action.

Survivors of abuse deserve much more, but certainly no less.
